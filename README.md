# Automatic Curtain Opener

## Overview
The Automatic Curtain Opener project aims to develop a system capable of automatically opening and closing curtains in theaters, auditoriums, conference halls, and similar venues. This GitHub repository hosts the project documentation, source code, and resources related to the development of the Automatic Curtain Opener.

## Project Description
The Automatic Curtain Opener utilizes a single-phase induction motor, a forward-reverse starter, and two limit switches to control the movement of curtains. The system is designed to respond to user input, automatically adjusting the position of the curtains based on the stage's activities.

## Components
- Single-phase induction motor
- Forward-reverse starter
- Two limit switches
- Push buttons
- Contractor

## Functionality
The mechanism operates as follows:
1. **User Input**: Users can activate the system using push buttons.
2. **Motor Control**: The single-phase induction motor is controlled by the forward-reverse starter, allowing it to rotate in either direction based on the current flow through its main winding.
3. **Curtain Movement**: The motor's rotation direction determines whether the curtains open or close.
4. **Limit Switches**: Two limit switches are employed to halt the motor's operation once the curtains reach their fully open or fully closed positions.
